## pakv Project 1: The Rust toolbox

**Task**: Create an in-memory key/value store that passes simple tests and responds
to command-line arguments.

**Goals**:

- Install the Rust compiler and tools
- Learn the project structure used throughout this course
- Use `cargo init` / `run` / `test` / `clippy` / `fmt`
- Learn how to find and import crates from crates.io
- Define an appropriate data type for a key-value store

**Topics**: testing, the `clap` crate, `CARGO_VERSION` etc., the `clippy` and
  `rustfmt` tools.

**Extensions**: the `structopt` crate.

## Introduction

In this project you will create a simple in-memory key/value store that maps
strings to strings, and that passes some tests and responds to command line
arguments. The focus of this project is on the tooling and setup that goes into
a typical Rust project.

If this sounds basic to you, please do the project anyway as it discusses some
general patterns that will be used throughout the course.
